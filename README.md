# Raspberry Pi Setup Guide with Ansible and Services

This guide walks you through the process of setting up a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B running Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit), installing required tools, configuring services like AdGuard, Portainer, and WireGuard, and managing everything using Ansible.

## Prerequisites

- **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B** running Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)
- **MicroSD card** to install Raspberry Pi OS
- **Ansible** installed on your host machine (refer to the [Ansible installation guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html))

## Step 1: Flash Raspberry Pi OS on a microSD Card

1. Install [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) on your host machine.
2. Use the Imager to flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) onto the microSD card.

## Step 2: Find the Raspberry Pi's IP Address

You can find your Raspberry Pi's IP address using one of the following methods:

1. **Router Interface**: Log into your router's web interface and check the list of connected devices. Look for your Raspberry Pi, often named "raspberrypi" or its hostname.
2. **Network Scanner**: Use a network scanning tool like [Angry IP Scanner](https://angryip.org/download/) to discover devices on your network.
3. **Direct Connection**: Connect a monitor to your Raspberry Pi using a mini HDMI to HDMI cable, and view the IP address directly on the screen after it boots up.

## Step 3: SSH into Raspberry Pi

1. On your host machine, run the following command to SSH into the Raspberry Pi:
   ```zsh
   ssh username@your-rpi-ip-here
   ```

## Step 4: Setup SSH Keys

1. Generate an SSH key pair on your host machine:
   ```zsh
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-host-machine-name"
   ```
2. Copy the public key to the Raspberry Pi:
   ```zsh
   ssh-copy-id -i generated_key_name.pub admin@your-rpi-ip-here
   ```

3. Simplify SSH Access Using SSH Config File:
   ```zsh
   Host pi
   Hostname your-rpi-ip-here
   User admin
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/private_keys/generated_key_name
   ```

This allows you to use a simple alias (pi) instead of typing the full SSH command each time.

## Step 5: Configure SSH in Ansible

Add the following configuration to your Ansible [inventory file](/inventory.ini):

```ini
[pi]
pi1 ansible_host=your-rpi-ip-here ansible_user=admin ansible_private_key_file=~/.ssh/private_keys/generated_key_name
```

Make sure to update `your-rpi-ip-here` with the actual IP address of your Raspberry Pi.

## Step 6: Test Ansible Connectivity

Run the following command to test the connection to the Raspberry Pi using Ansible:

```zsh
ansible -i inventory.ini pi -m ping
```

## Step 7: Configuration Files

Before running the Ansible playbook, ensure you modify and include the following configuration files for the services you are setting up (e.g., Traefik and AdGuard). These files need to be correctly updated and placed before proceeding.

### 1. **Environment Variables**: [.env](/files/docker-compose/.env)

Update the Cloudflare email and API key variables. Obtain the API key from the [Cloudflare API Tokens page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) under the **Global API Key** section.

```zsh
CF_API_EMAIL=your-cloudflare-email
CF_API_KEY=your-cloudflare-api-key
```

For WireGuard configuration, update the following:

- **`PEER_DNS_SERVER`**: Point this to your Pi's IP address.
- **`SERVER_URL`**: Provide a public-facing domain name or IP address. If you have a domain name, create an **A Record** in your domain registrar pointing to your public IP. You can check your public IP [here](https://whatismyipaddress.com/).

```zsh
PEER_DNS_SERVER=your-pi-ip-here
SERVER_URL=your-public-ip-or-domain
```

---

### 2. **Pi User Variables**: [pi_vars.yml](vars/pi_vars.yml)

This file contains the group and username for the Pi user. Ensure the information here matches your setup.

---

### 3. **Homepage Services**: [services.yaml](files/docker-compose/homepage/config/services.yaml)

Update the **href** for the AdGuard service to point to your Pi's IP address:

```yaml
- Adguard:
    icon: adguard-home.png
    href: http://your-pi-ip-here:8080
    description: Advanced DNS Management, Privacy Protection, and Network Control
```

---

### 4. **Traefik Configuration**: [traefik.yml](files/docker-compose/traefik/config/traefik.yml)

Update the email address used for certificate issuance:

```yaml
certificatesResolvers:
  cloudflare:
    acme:
      email: your-email@example.com
      storage: /cloudflare/acme.json
      dnsChallenge:
        provider: cloudflare
        resolvers:
          - "1.1.1.1:53"
          - "1.0.0.1:53"
```

Once complete, you can proceed to the next step.

## Step 8: Run the Ansible Playbook

Once the connectivity test is successful, run the Ansible playbook:

```zsh
ansible-playbook main.yml
```

## Step 9: AdGuard Home Setup

AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side software for that.

1. Open the following URL on your Raspberry Pi's IP address to begin the AdGuard setup:
   ```
   http://your-rpi-ip-here:3000/install.html
   ```

2. During the setup, select the correct network interface and configure the following:

   - **Admin Web Interface:** Set to port `8080` (port `80` is in use by Traefik, and port `3000` is used by the temporary dashboard).
   - **DNS Server:** Use port `53` if not already in use.

3. Enter your desired **username** and **password**.

4. Configure DNS in the AdGuard interface:
   - Go to `http://your-rpi-ip-here:8080/#dns`
   - Add upstream DNS servers like:
     - `1.1.1.1`
     - `1.0.0.1`

5. Test and apply the upstream DNS settings.

6. Add DNS rewrites for your custom domain:
   - Go to `http://your-rpi-ip-here:8080/#dns_rewrites`
   - Add a new DNS rewrite for:
     - **Domain**: `*.local.lowie.xyz`
     - **IP**: `your-rpi-ip-here`

   Once your DNS is set to `your-rpi-ip-here`, you can access other services.

## Step 10: Portainer Setup

Portainer is a lightweight management UI that simplifies the deployment and management of Docker containers. It provides an intuitive interface for monitoring, configuring, and controlling your containers and services.

1. To restart Portainer, use the following command if there is a timeout:
   ```zsh
   docker restart portainer
   ```

2. Create an account in the Portainer interface.

3. To generate an API token, visit:
   ```
   https://portainer.local.your.domain/#!/account/tokens/new
   ```

4. Set the API key in your `homepage/config/` directory.

## Step 11: WireGuard Setup

WireGuard is a modern VPN (Virtual Private Network) solution that is fast, secure, and simple to configure. It creates encrypted tunnels to protect your online activity, ensuring privacy and security, whether you're on public Wi-Fi or accessing your home network remotely.

1. **Set up a Domain Name**:
   For WireGuard, configure a **domain name** that points to your Raspberry Pi. Ensure that you forward port `51820` on your router to the Piâ€™s internal IP address.

2. **Obtain the QR Code**:
   To easily configure the WireGuard client, you can retrieve the necessary QR code by running the following command:

   ```zsh
   docker logs wireguard
   ```

   This will output the QR code, which you can scan using the WireGuard mobile app to configure your client.

## Step 12: Samba Share

Samba is a software suite that allows file sharing between Linux and Windows systems. It enables your Raspberry Pi to share files and directories with other devices on the network, making it accessible for both Linux and Windows users.

Run the following command after running the Ansible playbook to ensure your Samba user admin is set up correctly:

```zsh
sudo smbpasswd -a admin
```

## Troubleshooting

- If any service is not working, verify the configuration, check the logs, and ensure the ports are correctly forwarded on your router.
